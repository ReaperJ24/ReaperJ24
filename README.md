- 👋 Hi, I’m @ReaperJ24
- 👀 I’m interested in database management and broadening my understanding of all coding languages. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Client-Side JavaScript and Server-Side C# and API's. I am also in a C# class working with it as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner projects to help build my portfolio to help myself learn Github.
- 📫 Easiest way to reach me is at my Discord @ReaperJ24#0000.
